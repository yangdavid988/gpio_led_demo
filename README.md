# Hello World example for Ameba RTL8721Dx Series SoC（free_rtos）
* [中文版](./README_CN.md)


This is a "Hello World" program based on the RTL8721Dx series SoC. It demonstrates the effects of different log levels in the system and checks WiFi connectivity and IP acquisition via DHCP.

## Features

- Automatically prints system event logs at different levels during initialization.
- Prints "Hello World" every second after successfully connecting to WiFi and obtaining an IP address.
- Pauses message printing if the WiFi connection is lost and resumes once it is restored.

## Working Principle

1. **Log Levels**: Displays logs of various levels (such as info, warning, error) during program initialization.
2. **WiFi Connection**: The system attempts to connect to WiFi and obtain an IP address.
3. **Message Loop**: Two threads are started in the program: thread 1 listens for the IP address, and thread 2 prints "Hello World".
4. **WiFi Disconnection**: When WiFi is disconnected, the printing of "Hello World" is paused and resumes after reconnection.

## Quick Start

1. **Select SDK**
   - Set the path for `env.sh` (`env.bat`): `source {sdk}/env.sh`
   - Replace `{sdk}` with the absolute path to `env.sh` in the root directory of the [ameba-rtos SDK](https://github.com/Ameba-AIoT/ameba-rtos). This step only needs to be performed once if the SDK path remains unchanged.

2. **Compile**
   - Execute the following in the HELLO_WORLD root directory:
     ```bash
     source env.sh
     ameba.py build
     ```

3. **Flash Burning**
   ```bash
   ameba.py flash --p COMx --image km4_boot_all.bin 0x08000000 0x8014000 --image km0_km4_app.bin 0x08014000 0x8200000
   ```
   **Note**: Precompiled bin files are provided in the project directory, which can be directly flashed using:
   ```bash
   ameba.py flash --p COMx --image ../km4_boot_all.bin 0x08000000 0x8014000 --image ../km0_km4_app.bin 0x08014000 0x8200000
   ```

4. **Monitor**
   - `ameba.py monitor --port COM5 --b 1500000`

5. **Connect to WiFi**
   - Use AT commands to connect to WiFi. Refer to [AT+WLCONN](https://riot.realmcu.com/cn/latest/rtos/atcmd/at_command_wifi.html#at-wlconn) for details.
   - Example: `AT+WLCONN=ssid,Xiaomi_Pro_2G,pw,12345678`

6. **Observe Log Outputs**

7. **Reboot the AP and observe log outputs**

8. **Press the RESET button on the development board and observe automatic WiFi reconnection**
